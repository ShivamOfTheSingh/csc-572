## Shader Refresh

The purpose of this lab is to refresh your skills with the modern graphics pipeline while giving you flexibility in tools and programming environments. You may use your CSC 471 final project code (extending or cleaning up your existing C++/OpenGL framework) as starter code, or you may choose to work in an alternative environment such as WebGL with JavaScript or another comparable graphics framework.

For this assignment, you will be provided with a sample OBJ model and a texture. Your task is to load and render the model with the following required components:

- Transformations: Implement model, view, and projection transforms so that geometry is positioned and viewed correctly.

- Camera: Provide interactive camera controls (orbit, pan, zoom, or equivalent).

- Lighting: Implement at least one light source and apply it in your shader to produce lit, shaded geometry.

- Shaders: Write and use your own vertex and fragment shaders to handle data flow, shading, and texturing.

You are encouraged to extend this basic setup (e.g., multiple lights, additional camera modes, multiple textures), but the core requirements are a functioning shader pipeline, transformations, camera, and lighting.

Deliverables:

- A working program that loads the provided OBJ and texture, applies transformations, and renders it with shading.

- A live demo of your program during your lab section by end of week 1.

This lab is designed to ensure that everyone begins the quarter with a working graphics development environment and a refreshed understanding of the shader pipeline, regardless of the programming language or framework chosen.
