Welcome to CSC 572: Computer Graphics

Welcome to advanced computer graphics. This course builds on the foundations of CSC 471 and explores cutting-edge techniques, research directions, and modern graphics technologies. You will go beyond the basics of the graphics pipeline to study advanced rendering, global illumination, GPU programming, real-time techniques, visualization, and some applications of computer vision.

This course requires math and programming skills. Prior experience with C++ (or a similar language) and linear algebra is essential, and familiarity with graphics concepts from CSC 471 (e.g., GLSL) is assumed. I will provide support, example code, and opportunities to learn from one another, but you should be prepared for the independence and depth expected at the graduate level.

     Most people learn best in a social context - my goal is for you to learn via forming a community of scholars with your classmates.
    In general, the Syllabus link and Modules link on the left-side Course Navigation Menu are likely most useful and you can learn more about this class:
